Hi ya'll. Making a text-editor whilst following a tutorial on
https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html.

I'm going to add more features in the future if I feel like it. I would like to
make this editor into something I would actually use day-to-day.

Platform-level TODOs:
- make 'kilo' boot up a menu (new file, open file, (settings?)).
- make 'kilo filename' open said file.
- resizing the terminal.
- implement "save" and "save as" (guard against overwriting).
- implement multiple files opened at once (ctrl-shift-arrow left-right to switch between tabs).
- auto-save to a seperate copy every minute (file.c -> RECENT_file.c).

Editor-level TODOs:
- treat tabs as spaces.
- settings left/right select.
- incremental cursor position.
- line overflow.
- highlight C-style comments (more like de-highlight; a gray would work well).
- implement "jump to line number" feature.
- make the background a pleasing dark color.
- highlight TODO (red), NOTE (green), BUG (orange), STUDY (blue), IMPORTANT (yellow).
- implement case-insensitive search.
- add arrow key movement and CTRL+arrow key movement (don't make it go to the first non-empty character, it's annoying).
- page up and page down (ctrl-shift-arrow up/down).
- delete line, cut line, paste line.
- Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-Y.
- display the god damn line numbers please.
- multiple-line select (shortcut to select mode, then press a certain key to select lines and then copy/cut/delete).
- several clipboards and clipboard navigation.
- highlight currently opened file name (cyan/magenta?).
- select all.
- case-sensitive search-and-replace.
- shortcut list (CTRL-?).
- recently-opened files list (some shortcut, and make it so you can open them in a new tab).
- close-tab (ask if you want to save before closing).
- display file size in bytes and in lines (at the bottom probably).
- jump to start of file and to end of file (CTRL-A up-down arrow?).
- bookmarked files list (CTRL-something for bookmarking a file and CTRL-SHIFT-something for the list).

Other TODOs:
- make it so it boots without having to put ./ at the start in the terminal.
- make it so kilo is recognized by the OS as an actual application that you can launch from the start menu.
- make sure this thing runs on more than my own machine (Linux, MacOS maybe?, Cygwin/Bash for Windows probably).
